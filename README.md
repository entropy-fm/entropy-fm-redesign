Playing around with a redesign

Progress can be viewed at: https://entropyfm.netlify.app/

## Usage
1. Install Gatsby `npm install -g gatsby-cli`
2. Install packages `yarn install`
3. Start app `gatsby develop`

You will need to create a local `.env.development` file in the root directory that contains application secrets. This will not be checked in to git. You can take a look at `.env.example` to get an idea of the format. Contact @teddywilson or an admin to retrieve the secrets that you will use locally.
